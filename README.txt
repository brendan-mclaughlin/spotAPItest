Basic Spotify website.
Important Package for API Calls: https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node

Goals:
  -Using full potential of Spotify's dev tools to add more functionality when dealing with large song library.
  -More personal profile. When looking at someones profile its very boring. 

End result is to have personal Spotify site showing what I am curently playing and options to view my personal liked songs. Have options to automate sorting library into genres and then creating playlist off of results. 

Current playing song cover automatically updating(DONE).
Rotating current albumn cover(DONE)
  -Common issue with styled components rotating fixed https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components/issues/216
Sorting liked songs library based on genres(Spotify beat me to it).
